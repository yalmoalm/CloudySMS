Introduction
This project provides a basic yet practical introduction to working with APIs and extracting information from the web. It serves as a hands-on experience in dealing with web-based data and demonstrates how to process and deliver this data effectively to end users.

Overview
In this project, I utilized the requests library to extract information from the web and store it in a JSON file. After processing and manipulating the extracted data, I integrated an API from the Twilio platform along with its Python library to develop a bot. This bot sends curated information directly to the user's phone in a clean and user-friendly format.

Key Features
API Integration: Extraction of web-based data using the requests library.
Data Manipulation: Processing and structuring the data for user-friendly delivery.
SMS Bot: Automated messaging system leveraging Twilio's API to send information to users' phones.
Learning Experience
This project introduced me to the worlds of software development and networking, giving me a foundational understanding of how APIs work and how data can be effectively managed and delivered. It enhanced my technical skills in Python, data handling, and API integration, while also improving my ability to solve real-world problems with code.
