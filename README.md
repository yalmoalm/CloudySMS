# **CloudySMS**

## **Introduction**
This project provides a basic yet practical introduction to working with APIs and extracting information from the web. It serves as a hands-on experience in dealing with web-based data and demonstrates how to process and deliver this data effectively to end users.

## **Overview**
- Utilized the `requests` library to extract information from the web and save it in a JSON file.
- Processed and manipulated the extracted data to format it for user-friendly delivery.
- Developed a bot using Twilio's API and Python library to send curated information directly to users' phones via SMS.

## **Key Features**
- **API Integration**: Seamless extraction of web-based data using Python's `requests` library.
- **Data Manipulation**: Efficient processing and structuring of raw data.
- **Automated SMS Bot**: Delivery of formatted data to users via Twilio's API.

## **Learning Experience**
This project introduced me to the fundamentals of:
- Software development and networking.
- API integration and handling JSON data.
- Automating tasks using Python and external libraries.

Through this project, I expanded my technical skills and gained confidence in tackling real-world problems with code.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- `requests` library
- Twilio API
